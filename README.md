# SQL Query Portfolio - Tiffany Robinson

Welcome to my **SQL Query Portfolio**! This collection of SQL queries demonstrates my ability to analyze fraud and customer data using basic to intermediate SQL techniques. Each query includes a brief description, why it’s important, and the expected output. This portfolio highlights my growing skills in data analysis and fraud prevention.
