# SQL Query Portfolio - Tiffany Robinson

This portfolio contains basic to intermediate SQL queries focusing on fraud analysis and customer data. Each query includes a description, why itâ€™s important, and the expected output.

## Queries Included:
- **Total Transactions by Customer**: Helps identify high-volume customers.
- **Average Resolution Time for Fraud Cases**: Measures how long it takes to resolve fraud cases.
- **Fraudulent Transactions by Type**: Shows common fraud patterns.

## Tools Used:
- AI tools (like ChatGPT) for drafting and refining queries.
- Sample or dummy datasets to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Notes:
- This project highlights my growing skills in SQL and my focus on fraud prevention and data analysis.
